Hello,

The files are in jupyter which was new to me 3 days ago, This was less a refresher, more a learning experience but it was still enjoyable and I learned how to use new tools. 

Before running please make sure to install the requrements, Sometimes it also seems like Jupyter runs all, but somehow doesnt? It will say thinks like df not a variable, when I specifified it a cell above. If that happens just press run again, fixed it for me every time
